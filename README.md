The talk was created by [Brian Farris](https://github.com/brianfarris/) for a DS30 webinar by [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/) ([github](https://github.com/thedataincubator/)).  Brian Farris is a data scientist at Capital One Labs in New York. He was a [Data Incubator Fellow](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html) in the [Spring 2015 NYC cohort](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2015/08/columbia-astrophysics-postdoc-moves-to-capital-one-labs-alumni-spotlight-on-brian-farris/). Prior to this he was a postdoc in computational astrophysics at Columbia and NYU, working on simulations of the environments around binary black holes. He received his PhD in Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
